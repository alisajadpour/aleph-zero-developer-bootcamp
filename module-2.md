In this module, we will cover how to write smart contracts using **Ink!**, a Rust-based framework for Substrate blockchains. Youâ€™ll learn how to deploy contracts and interact with the Aleph Zero blockchain.

## Key Concepts:
- Ink! smart contract language
- Contract deployment on Aleph Zero
- Rust programming basics

## Exercises:
1. Write and deploy your first Ink! contract.
2. Test the contract on a local Aleph Zero network.
